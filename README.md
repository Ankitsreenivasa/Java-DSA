## Introduction

This repository serves as an educational resource for understanding arrays and two fundamental searching algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search. The implementations are provided in Java, along with explanations and examples.

## Array Operations

The repository includes various operations and functionalities related to arrays, such as:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Array traversal and printing
- Basic array algorithms

Each array operation is accompanied by code examples and explanations.

## Linear Search

Linear Search, also known as sequential search, is a simple searching algorithm. It traverses the array sequentially to find the target element.

Implementation of Linear Search includes:
- Linear Search algorithm in Java
- Explanation of its working
- Example usage scenarios

## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted arrays. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half to locate the target element.

Implementation of Binary Search includes:
- Binary Search algorithm in Java
- Explanation of its working and efficiency
- Example usage scenarios
